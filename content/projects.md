I started looking into electrifying my house and learned about the effectiveness of electric heat pumps to heat and cool while fighting climate change. As I dug deeper, I realized there were a lot of calculations to determine if they were worthwhile that depended on local factors like the weather and price of energy. I built this site to help others determine if heat pumps will work for them.

I wanted to install solar panels to power my home, but it was hard to determine if it was a good investment. So, I built this calculator to simulate cash flows from utility bill savings and other factors. Using that info, the calculator determines a solar installation's NPV, IRR, and payback period to help you decide whether it is a good investment. In my specific situation, all the federal and state government incentives helped me see it was a no-brainer.
