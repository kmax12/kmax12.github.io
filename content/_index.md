I am VP of Data Science Engineering at the [Alteryx Innovation Labs](https://www.alteryx.com/innovation-labs) where I build technology to make machine learning easier to use. 

In 2015, I cofounded Feature Labs. We built open source machine learning libraries currently used by tens of thousands of people around the world when Alteryx acquired us in 2019.

Before that, I worked as an engineer at Hewlett Packard, Fitbit, Twitter, and the New York Times. 

I've also invested in early stage startups as a founding member of Dorm Room Fund in Boston.
