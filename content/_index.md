Hi! Iâ€™m Max ðŸ‘‹

I like data, software engineering, and building companies.

Currently, I'm a Visiting Scholar in the [Data to AI][2] Lab at MIT and researching solutions to challenges in the transition away from fossil fuels.

Previously, I co-founded [Feature Labs][1] where we built machine learning software used by tens of thousands of people.

After running Feature Labs as CEO for 4 years, we were acquired by Alteryx (NYSE: AYX) to democratizing machine learning for their 300,000 customers. In particular, I led the development of their cloud AutoML product from inception to commercial availability.

I also invest in and advise early-stage startups, including time as a founding member of [Dorm Room Fund][6] in Boston, where I invested in 20+ companies.

Check out my [blog posts][3], [projects][7], [papers][4], and [bookshelf][5].
