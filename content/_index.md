Hi! Iâ€™m Max ðŸ‘‹

I like data, software engineering, and building companies.

In 2015, I co-founded [Feature Labs][1]. We built machine learning software used by tens of thousands of developers worldwide. 

After running Feature Labs as CEO for 4 years, we were acquired by Alteryx (NYSE: AYX) to form their Innovation Labs where we worked to democratizing machine learning for their 300,000 customers. In particular, I led the development of a new cloud AutoML product from inception to commercial availability while quadrupling the original Feature Labs team to 40 software engineers.

Before that, I studied computer science at MIT, where I did research in the [Data to AI][2] Lab.

I also invest in and advise early-stage startups, including time as a founding member of [Dorm Room Fund][5] in Boston, where I invested in 20+ student-founded startups.

Check out the [blog posts][3] and [papers][4] Iâ€™ve written.
