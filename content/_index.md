Hi! I'm Max ðŸ‘‹

I like data, software engineering, and building companies. 

In 2015, I cofounded Feature Labs. We built machine learning software used by tens of thousands of people around the world. After running Feature Labs as CEO for 4 years, we were aquired by Alteryx (NYSE: AYX).

At Alteryx, I formed the their "Innovation Labs" to focus on democratizing machine learning and data science for their 300,000 customers. In particular, I led development of their new cloud AutoML product from inception to commercial availability while quadrupling the original Feature Labs team to 40 people. 

Before that, I studied computer science at MIT where I did research in the [Data to AI](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) Lab. During the my summers, I worked as an engineer at Hewlett Packard, Fitbit, Twitter, and the New York Times. 

I've also invest and advise early stage startups including time as a founding member of Dorm Room Fund in Boston where I invested in 20+ student-founded startups.
