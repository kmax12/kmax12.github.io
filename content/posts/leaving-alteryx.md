After 2 years, last month marked the end of my time at Alteryx. 

It's been a truly incredible experience going through the acquisition of Feature Labs and developing Alteryx’s new cloud AutoML product from inception to commercial availability. 

Looking back on all the moments over the last 7 years, the most consequential was following my curiosity towards the interesting idea of automating feature engineering / machine learning. Pursuing that arguably crazy idea was only possible because during a school break with no commitments I hacked together a prototype that convinced me I should refocus my masters thesis.

And as they say…the rest is history. My research prototype turned into a peer-reviewed paper, a popular open source library, a company named Feature Labs, Alteryx Machine learning, and an amazing group of coworkers and friends. 

For the first time since then, I have the opportunity to follow my curiosity with nothing to lose.
