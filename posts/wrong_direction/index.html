I knew nothing about what I wanted to do. I just thought it was cool. I had no goals I wanted to achieve. Graduating wasn’t even one of them (story for another time)</p><p>The idea got started while I was a student at MIT. The key to success was my advisor Kalyan pointing me in the right direction.</p><p>After graduating I started a company named Feature Labs around the technology. I had previously tried to start 2 companies while at MIT (RIP Kangacruise and LifetimeSupply). I poured everything I had into making them successful. But they both failed before getting customers. When I start ed Feature Labs, I would do something different. I focused on bootstrapping the business to make sure we were heading in the direction of what customers would pay for.</p><p>Once we validated customer would pay, we open sourced the technology. This made sure we were building in the direction of what users found useful.</p><p>We eventually raised a 1.5 million dollar seed round. While we finally had a safety net of money in the bank. Our funding paled in comparison to our competitors who in some cases had raised 100x as much as us. Or we were competing against massive publicly companies spending 100X our funding just on marketing.</p><p>With less resources we had to work both harder and smarter i.e we had to make sure we were running the right direction.</p><p>4 years into Feature Labs we had the amazing outcome of selling the company to the biggest player in our space.</p><p>While we we’re no longer resource constrained, the goals were clear. I wanted to build a world class team and a cloud autoML platform for Alteryx.</p><p>I stayed laser focused the last two years on that goal and I can proudly say that there is now in fact a world class engineering team at Alteryx who has released an incrediblely unique cloud AutoML product.</p><p>The last 7 years all kicked off because my curiosity lead me in the direction of a new technology and great group of people to work with.</p><p>Now, it’s time to do that again by starting to running again, even if it might be in the wrong direction.</p><p>That &ldquo;school break&rdquo; was MIT&rsquo;s IAP (Independent Activites Period). IAP is a month long period at the beginning of January where students don&rsquo;t have any required classes and can work on whatever is interesting to them. For me, that included things like getting my scuba certification, building furniture, traveling to silcon valley, and quality bonding my friends.</p></div></div><hr><div class=container><nav class="navbar navbar-expand navbar-light px-0"><ul class=navbar-nav><li class="nav-item pl-0"><a id=home-nav-link class="nav-link pl-0" href=/>Max Kanter</a></li></ul><ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto"><li class=nav-item><a class="nav-link active" href=/posts>Posts</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/bookshelf>Bookshelf</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div></div><script>window.ga=function(){ga.q.push(arguments)},ga.q=[],ga.l=+new Date,ga("create","UA-10903109-3","auto"),ga("set","transport","beacon"),ga("send","pageview")</script><script src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js async></script></body></html>
