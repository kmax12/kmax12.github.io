I started looking into electrifying my house and learned about the effectiveness of electric heat pumps to heat and cool while fighting climate change. As I dug deeper, I realized there were a lot of calculations to determine if they were worthwhile that depended on local factors like the weather and price of energy. I built this site to help others determine if heat pumps will work for them."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.jmaxkanter.com/projects/"><meta property="article:section" content><meta property="og:image" content="https://www.jmaxkanter.com/open-graph.jpg"><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"></head><body><div class=container><nav class="navbar navbar-expand navbar-light px-0"><ul class=navbar-nav><li class="nav-item pl-0"><a id=home-nav-link class="nav-link pl-0" href=/>Max Kanter</a></li></ul><ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto"><li class=nav-item><a class=nav-link href=/posts>Posts</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class="nav-link active" href=/projects>Projects</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=container><header><div class="row pt-4"><div class=col><h1>Projects</h1></div></div></header><div class="row py-2"><div class=col><div class=project style=margin-bottom:20px;margin-top:10px><p><b>Heat Pumps Work</b></p><p>I started looking into electrifying my house and learned about the effectiveness of electric heat pumps to heat and cool while fighting climate change.

So, I built this calculator to simulate cash flows from utility bill savings and other factors. Using that info, the calculator determines the NPV, IRR, and payback period of a solar installation to help you determine if it is a good investment. In my specific situation, with all the federal and state government incentives, it&rsquo;s helped me see it was a no brainer.</p><a href=https://www.solarcellswork.com/ target=_blank><b>SolarCellsWork.com ➜</b></a><hr></div><div class=project style=margin-bottom:20px;margin-top:10px><p><b>Featuretools</b></p><p>An open source framework I created to perform automated feature engineering.
